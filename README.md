## Installation

```bash
pip install centinel
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pytest (for running tests)
- rich (for example outputs)

## Quick Start

```python
from centinel import Money, Currency

# Create money objects
amount1 = Money(100, Currency.USD)
amount2 = Money(50, Currency.USD)

# Basic operations
total = amount1 + amount2  # 150.00 USD
difference = amount1 - amount2  # 50.00 USD
doubled = amount1 * 2  # 200.00 USD
halved = amount1 / 2  # 50.00 USD

# Currency conversion
from centinel import convert
euros = convert(amount1, Currency.EUR)  # 85.00 EUR
```

## Advanced Features

### Currency Conversion

```python
from centinel import Money, Currency, convert, update_exchange_rate

# Update exchange rates
update_exchange_rate(Currency.USD, Currency.EUR, 0.85)

# Convert with custom rates
amount = Money(100, Currency.USD)
euros = convert(amount, Currency.EUR)  # Using updated rate

# Historical rates support
from datetime import date
store_historical_rate(Currency.USD, Currency.EUR, 0.95, date(2024, 1, 1))
historical_euros = convert(amount, Currency.EUR, date(2024, 1, 1))
```

### Financial Operations

```python
from centinel import AdvancedOperations, RoundingPolicy

# Compound interest
principal = Money(1000, Currency.USD)
result = AdvancedOperations.compound_interest(principal, 0.05, 1)  # 5% for 1 year

# Percentage calculations
amount = Money(200, Currency.USD)
percentage = AdvancedOperations.percentage_of(amount, 15)  # 15% of amount

# Rounding policies
rounded = AdvancedOperations.apply_rounding(amount, RoundingPolicy.HALF_UP)

# Financial ratios
profit_margin = AdvancedOperations.profit_margin(revenue, costs)
debt_equity = AdvancedOperations.debt_to_equity(debt, equity)
```

### Performance Optimizations

```python
from centinel import OptimizedMoney, BatchProcessor

# Optimized money operations
opt_money = OptimizedMoney(100, Currency.USD)

# Batch processing
processor = BatchProcessor()
amounts = [Money(100, Currency.USD) for _ in range(1000)]
total = processor.batch_add(amounts)
converted = processor.batch_convert(amounts, Currency.EUR)

# Performance metrics
metrics = processor.get_performance_metrics()
```

## Thread Safety

All currency conversion and exchange rate operations are thread-safe, making Centinel suitable for high-frequency trading environments. The library implements:

- Thread-safe exchange rate management
- Concurrent batch processing
- Object pooling for memory efficiency
- Optimized caching for exchange rates

## Error Handling

```python
from centinel.exceptions import MoneyOverflowError, CurrencyMismatchError

try:
    large_amount = Money(2_147_483_648, Currency.USD)  # Will raise MoneyOverflowError
except MoneyOverflowError:
    print("Amount exceeds 4-byte integer limit")

try:
    usd = Money(100, Currency.USD)
    eur = Money(100, Currency.EUR)
    total = usd + eur  # Will raise CurrencyMismatchError
except CurrencyMismatchError:
    print("Cannot add different currencies directly")
```

## Configuration

### Exchange Rate Provider

```python
from centinel import ExchangeRateProvider

class CustomProvider(ExchangeRateProvider):
    def get_rate(self, from_currency: Currency, to_currency: Currency) -> float:
        # Implement custom rate fetching logic
        pass

# Use custom provider
set_exchange_rate_provider(CustomProvider())
```

### Performance Settings

```python
from centinel import configure_performance

configure_performance(
    enable_caching=True,
    pool_size=1000,
    batch_size=100,
    max_threads=4
)
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Based on our performance tests with 100,000 operations:

- Regular Addition: ~0.092s
- Optimized Addition: ~0.036s
- Concurrent Batch Addition: ~0.039s

This represents a 2.5x performance improvement using optimized operations.
