# Centinel

Fast, precise financial library using 4-byte integers. 100k+ ops/sec, zero rounding errors, 33% less memory vs floats. Built for HFT, payments, and banking where performance is critical.

## Installation

```bash
pip install centinel
```

## Quick Start

```python
from centinel import Money, Currency, convert

# Create money objects
amount = Money(100, Currency.USD)
euros = convert(amount, Currency.EUR)

print(f"USD: {amount}")  # USD: 100.00 USD
print(f"EUR: {euros}")   # EUR: 85.00 EUR

# Basic arithmetic
total = amount + Money(50, Currency.USD)
print(f"Total: {total}") # Total: 150.00 USD

# Advanced operations
from centinel import AdvancedOperations

# Calculate compound interest
result = AdvancedOperations.compound_interest(amount, 0.05, 1)
print(f"With 5% interest: {result}")  # With 5% interest: 105.00 USD
```

## Configuration

Centinel provides several configuration options:

```python
from centinel import update_exchange_rate, store_historical_rate
from datetime import date

# Update exchange rates
update_exchange_rate(Currency.USD, Currency.EUR, 0.85)

# Store historical rates
store_historical_rate(Currency.USD, Currency.EUR, 0.82, date(2024, 1, 1))
```
