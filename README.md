[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/centinel.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/centinel/)

## Why?

Financial calculations require absolute precision and reliability. Traditional floating-point arithmetic can lead to rounding errors and precision loss, which is unacceptable in financial systems where even tiny discrepancies can result in significant monetary impacts. Centinel addresses these challenges through several key design decisions:

### 1. Integer-Based Precision

Instead of using floating-point numbers, Centinel uses 4-byte integers to represent monetary values (storing amounts in smallest currency units, e.g., cents). This approach:
- Eliminates floating-point rounding errors
- Guarantees exact arithmetic operations
- Prevents precision loss in calculations
- Ensures consistent results across different platforms

### 2. Thread-Safe Design

Modern financial systems, especially in trading environments, require concurrent processing of numerous transactions. Centinel is built with thread-safety at its core:
- Thread-safe exchange rate management prevents race conditions
- Concurrent batch processing enables efficient handling of multiple operations
- Object pooling reduces memory allocation overhead
- Optimized caching improves performance in high-frequency scenarios

### 3. Performance Focus

High-frequency trading environments demand both speed and accuracy. Centinel achieves this through:
- Efficient 4-byte integer operations
- Vectorized batch processing capabilities
- Minimal memory footprint
- Optimized algorithms for common financial calculations

### 4. Comprehensive Financial Support

Beyond basic arithmetic, financial systems need robust support for:
- Currency conversion with cross-rates
- Historical exchange rates
- Compound interest calculations
- Financial ratio computations
- Configurable rounding policies

## Features

- üí± Thread-safe currency conversion with cross-rate support
- üìä Advanced financial operations (compound interest, ratios)
- ‚ö° High-performance optimizations for trading environments
- üîÑ Batch operations with concurrent processing
- üìù Comprehensive test coverage
- ‚öôÔ∏è Full configuration options

## Installation

```bash
pip install centinel
```

## Quick Start

```python
from centinel import Money, Currency, convert

# Create money objects
amount = Money(100, Currency.USD)
euros = convert(amount, Currency.EUR)

print(f"USD: {amount}")  # USD: 100.00 USD
print(f"EUR: {euros}")   # EUR: 85.00 EUR

# Basic arithmetic
total = amount + Money(50, Currency.USD)
print(f"Total: {total}") # Total: 150.00 USD

# Advanced operations
from centinel import AdvancedOperations

# Calculate compound interest
result = AdvancedOperations.compound_interest(amount, 0.05, 1)
print(f"With 5% interest: {result}")  # With 5% interest: 105.00 USD
```

## Configuration

Centinel provides several configuration options:

```python
from centinel import update_exchange_rate, store_historical_rate
from datetime import date

# Update exchange rates
update_exchange_rate(Currency.USD, Currency.EUR, 0.85)

# Store historical rates
store_historical_rate(Currency.USD, Currency.EUR, 0.82, date(2024, 1, 1))
```
